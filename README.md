This was one of the projects I did during my education. We were to implement a
regex engine by constructing an NFA from the given expression and then run it.

We did the project using Qt Creator in order to add a GUI. The infix to postfix
converter class was given, together with the algorithm for running the NFA which
was to be implemented.
